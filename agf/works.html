            Antatah Gatva Foundation believes in spreading awareness about
            multiple stakeholders which help an individual in staying safe and
            healthy in these times of a global pandemic. We focus on educating
            individuals about how to stay out of risk and how to cope with the
            lockdown situation. <br />Following are the major concerns about
            which our NGO finds it necessary to spread awareness:

              <h3>Controlling the Population Growth</h3>
              <p class="text-justify">
                Due to the global pandemic, COVID-19 multiple areas have been
                put under lockdown because of which most of the people are
                either unemployed or working from home. Due to excessive
                availability of free time and lack of work, most of the people
                are indulging into intercourse and most of the time it is
                unprotected, eventually resulting in unwanted pregnancies and
                child births. This is not only adding to the population of our
                country but also adding up to the financial burden of the
                families which is difficult to cope with due to the economic
                state of our country at the moment. So, it is necessary that we
                spread awareness among the population to prevent our country
                from becoming even more populated than before.

              <h3>Taking Care of Health</h3>
              <p class="text-justify">
                The COVID-19 virus spreads due to physical contact, presence of
                an infected person in your surroundings and unhygienic
                conditions. Due to lack of sanitization, individuals become more
                vulnerable to the coronavirus and get infected easily. It is
                necessary that we wash hands and sanitize them and all the
                things we use along with the things which are brought into
                contact with other people as infected people act as the carriers
                of the virus. So, every individual should practice sanitization,
                maintain their hygiene and avoid human contact in order to stay
                healthy.

              <h3>Reducing Poverty</h3>
              <p class="text-justify">
                Almost about 22% of people are below the poverty line in India
                and lack basic amenities like food, shelter, education. As
                education is an asset for an individual, it is important that we
                educate the less privileged so that they can make a living by
                getting a job. Educating them will also make them aware about
                the current situation and will help them in staying out of the
                risk of getting infected by the normal virus. Educating the
                underprivileged will not only empower them but also make it easy
                for them to afford basic amenities and hence would reduce the
                poverty in our country.

              <h3>Effective Use of Resources</h3>
              <p class="text-justify">
                Since the global pandemic has indirectly affected the economic
                state of our country, it is absolutely necessary that we
                conserve the resources and restrict their use instead of
                spending them blindly. Resources like water and electricity
                should be conserved so that there are less power cuts and no
                water shortages. People should use the resources only to the
                extent where they are actually required and conserve them as
                much as possible in order to attain the financial stability of
                our country.

              </div>
              <h3>Employment Opportunities</h3>
              <p class="text-justify">
                More employment opportunities and better employment
                opportunities should be provided to those who are unemployed.
                The job opportunities should equal the qualification of the
                individual so that their abilities are put into maximum use and
                that they can earn the amount of money that they deserve. More
                employment can be introduced by encouraging more startup
                programs and finding angel investors who wish to sponsor the
                startups. This will increase employment and help people in
                staying focused on the right things.

              <h3>Access to Technology</h3>
              <p class="text-justify">
                To spread more awareness and to spread education during the time
                of a global pandemic it is necessary that internet and
                technology like smartphones and/or laptops is available for
                those who dearly wish to learn. The Internet is essential for
                staying updated and aware about the world, it also increases the
                awareness of an individual and helps them empower themselves. In
                today’s world, every important information is accessed via the
                internet and hence it becomes even more necessary to increase
                its access to the areas where it is barely available.

              <h3>Modern Approaches in Agriculture</h3>
              <p class="text-justify">
                Agriculture is the largest source of livelihood in India and
                majority of the rural households are dependent on agriculture
                for their livelihood. Most of them are small farmers who are
                land labours who often commit suicide due to the burden of debt.
                It is essential that waivers on farm loans are increased so that
                the income of farmers is increased and they do not die under the
                burden of debt. Modern approaches like removing interest rates
                on farm loans for small farmers should be executed so that more
                and more farmers get encouraged to take loans from banks and not
                from informal sector lenders.

              <h3>Respecting Animals and Nature</h3>
              <p class="text-justify">
                As individuals it is our responsibility to take care of the
                welfare of animals and nature. We should respect animals and we
                should not ill treat them by throwing stones at them or harming
                them for fun. We should be insensitive towards these creatures
                and help them and save them at all costs. During the global
                pandemic most of the people have stopped feeding stray dogs and
                other stray animals. We should save them from starvation by
                feeding them food whenever possible. As nature balances out
                whatever we do, our behaviour towards nature and animals will
                definitely repay us one day.

              <p class="text-justify">
                We should help people who lack enough sources to survive. Most
                of the people are unemployed at the moment and are dying of
                starvation. It is necessary that we turn sensitive towards these
                people and save them at all costs for the sake of humanity.We
                can help them by buying them food and other essential things for
                their survival. We should focus on ways of employing these
                people so that they can earn a livelihood for themselves.

                As individuals we should be aware about the conditions and
                situations in our surroundings and also around the globe. The
                more we stay aware, the more we stay out of the risk of getting
                involved in these situations. We as the responsible citizens of
                our country should actively participate in online forums and
                spread correct knowledge and information for the welfare of
                other people who are unaware about these situations.

                Antatah Gatva Foundation works for the underprivileged who
                cannot afford education and cannot take care of their health.
                Our foundation helps these people in getting education and also
                helps them in gaining awareness about health care and hygiene.
                As it is a Non Governmental Organization, it generates funds
                from the people who wish to contribute for the cause. As we
                believe that mankind together can save itself from the burden of
                poverty and starvation, it is necessary that we help those who
                need our support both financially and morally. Hence, contribute
                to our noble cause as we can make a difference!
